# ❓ Introduction
I’m currently a second-year student at **ESIEA Paris** as an apprentice engineer.  
I previously worked for **THALES** for one year and a half as an **attack/defence scenario design engineer** in cybersecurity.  
I am now an apprentice at **RandoriSec / Shindan**, working in **Android Malware Analysis**.  
You can check out my company's blog here(Android/iOS blog): [shindan.io/blog](https://shindan.io/blog)

I’m passionate about IT and cybersecurity, and I'm particularly interested in **malware analysis**, **forensics** and **OSINT**!
